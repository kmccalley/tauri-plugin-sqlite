//! Consumer-supplied scalar SQL functions, applied to every pooled connection.
//!
//! This module doc is the canonical statement of the scalar-function contract. The
//! READMEs, the plugin builder docs, and the CHANGELOG point here.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! A function belongs to a *connection*, not to a database file. SQLite keeps
//! user-defined functions in per-connection state, so every connection that runs a query
//! naming one must have it registered. [`register_function`] records a function in a
//! process-global set. [`crate::SqliteDatabase::connect`] snapshots that set, and the
//! pools' `after_connect` hook installs the snapshot on each connection they open. A
//! function is present before any caller receives a connection, and it stays present as
//! the pools drop idle connections and open new ones.
//!
//! Register a function before the `connect` call for the database that must serve it.
//! A database applies the functions registered before its `connect`, for every
//! connection it ever opens. A later registration applies to the next database, never to
//! part of an open one. Registration is process-global, and a function stays registered
//! for the life of the process. [`register_or_replace_function`] puts a different handler
//! under a name already registered, for the databases that connect after it.
//!
//! [`ScalarFunction::invocation_scope`] decides where SQLite accepts a call.
//! [`InvocationScope::DirectOnly`] confines the function to top-level SQL, so SQLite
//! refuses a call from inside a schema object: a view, a trigger, a CHECK constraint, a
//! DEFAULT clause, an expression index, a partial index, or a generated column. The error
//! reads `unsafe use of <name>()`. Direct-only keeps a handler out of the schema of a
//! database this application did not write, such as an attached file from sync or import.
//! It also stops a caller from naming the function in an expression index or a generated
//! column, which writes the name into the schema and leaves the table unreadable by any
//! process that opens the file without registering the function. The other two scopes
//! accept both of those risks in exchange for a function that a view or an index can
//! call.
//!
//! The handler is `Send + Sync + 'static` because sqlx runs every SQLite connection on
//! its own thread. Every connection of every database shares one handler. The handler
//! receives every argument, including SQL NULL, and decides what NULL means. Returning
//! [`SqlValue::Null`] produces NULL. A returned [`FunctionError`] fails the statement,
//! and the caller receives its message. A handler blocks its connection for as long as it
//! runs, and the write pool holds a single connection.
//!
//! If the application unwinds on panic (the Rust default), a panic inside the handler
//! becomes an error naming the function. Under `panic = "abort"`, the process aborts, and
//! nothing here can prevent that.
//!
//! Each of these fails at the [`register_function`] call, not later as a connection
//! error:
//!
//! - an empty name, a name over 255 bytes, or a name holding a NUL byte
//! - a negative arity
//! - a name a SQLite built-in already uses
//! - a name and arity pair already registered (names compare case-insensitively,
//!   matching how SQLite resolves them)
//! - a function the linked SQLite library refuses, such as an arity above its
//!   `SQLITE_MAX_FUNCTION_ARG`
//!
//! Aggregate functions, window functions, collations, and virtual tables are not
//! supported.
